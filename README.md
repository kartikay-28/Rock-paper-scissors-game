## 💡 Copilot Usage

GitHub Copilot was used to:
- Generate function suggestions for determining the winner.
- Recommend logic for score tracking and round flow.
- Propose helpful UI messages and structure.

However, the entire structure, logic, and final implementation were customized and written manually to enhance learning and control.
